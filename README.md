### Brief Summary
I hope to store most of my code here. But I'm using a rather cheap laptop that doesn't have enough processing power for NN training. 
So at some point I might need to use Google Colab service and save notebooks from there as well.

I'll try to keep code structered in different folders (each for a new part of the book maybe)

Well, the first part of the book is just theory, so I won't write much code here. But the second one is much more interesting.
